# Beginner-batch-Loader
Most simple Loader (BATCH)

ALL OF THE FILES U WANT TO START MUST BE IN A FOLDER, Cant be in downloads, documents, pictures, ETC, Make a folder for them or put then in a random folder.

start "c:\windows\system32" notepad.exe # Path Then file name, Makes sure to include the extension, ex: .exe .txt. bat .pdf, etc    # This pause is only if u want to start another application without It closing Right away! PAUSE
start "c:\windows\system32" notepad.exe   # Path Then file name, Makes sure to include the extension, ex: .exe .txt. bat .pdf, etc

By ALT, I spent 1 min making this for a friend so i just release for fun, Not that anybody is actually gonna use it lol, Enjoy
